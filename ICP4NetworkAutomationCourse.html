<p> The course is guaranteed to run on the dates below as long as there is at least one paying student enrolled. All students must pay to attend this course.</p>
<p> The ZN777 course is a self-paced course. The lectures are recorded and there are labs. The course will take two full days to complete but you are given three full days to complete the lectures and labs and provide time to work with the software.</p>
